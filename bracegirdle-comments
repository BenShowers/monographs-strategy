1.	What would a successful monographs strategy enable you to do?
a.	It would support both collection development and collection management at institutional and national level. 
b.	Provide a coherent case for collection management, including disposal, which would address the concerns of academics. 
c.	Providing additional study space is an important driver - providing attractive working environments where space is a service, rather than  just acting as book repositories. 
d.	Aid in the discovery and accessibility of monographs and help us target resources at rare and unique material
e.	Set a framework for issues related to ebook collections

2.	what’s the main barrier preventing you from achieving this
a.	obtaining academic buy-in – we need to make the distinction between different types of books (i.e. rare/unique material and textbooks) and provide reassurance that we are not disposing of important material or restricting access to knowledge. By acting collectively we are avoiding reputational damage to individual institutions
b.	how do we know if items are rare/unique?
